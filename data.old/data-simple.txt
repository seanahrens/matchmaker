These early years were foundational, as my grandfather instilled in me the importance of diving deep into my passions and understanding the consequences of my choices.\n\nBy four, I unearthed a natural talent for strategy, a skill that led me to clinch a regional championship in Go. My artistic side also flourished, culminating in becoming the lead YangQin performer at my school by eleven. My return to San Francisco presented new challenges, including a battle with obesity, which I overcame by shedding 70 lbs through disciplined training.\n\nIn high school and college, my leadership drove teams to win in investment competitions, CAPSIM, and hackathons. Now, in my banking career, I blend these experiences with my passion for technology. I innovate in machine learning and artificial intelligence, developing automation tools that not only streamline workflows but also enhance productivity. What sets my approach apart in banking is my focus on the human element. I delve deep into understanding founders and investors, grasping not only their technological approach, but also their vision and mission. This insight is critical in fostering and establishing fruitful relationships, ensuring a harmonious alignment of goals and expectations.\n\nSharing Excellence: A Curated Tech Perspective\nAs a final note, I am discerning in what I share and repost. The materials you see on my profile are not just random selections; they represent the crème de la crème of the tech world, carefully chosen for their excellence and relevance to my work.
